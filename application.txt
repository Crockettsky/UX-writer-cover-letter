### Cover letter

_**My name’s Zhelyazko**_, I’m based in Copenhagen, and I’m truly excited to apply for the UX Writer position.


**Long story short**, I've been in a writing mode for 10+ years, including content creation for financial institutions, technical descriptions of healthcare and software products, social media content, architecture journals, advertisement, etc. I believe that my ability and willingness to adapt and learn new things have played a significant role in my career. I'm experienced in working in larger teams, cooperating with just a few professionals, or managing projects independently. I thrive in a creative environment and like to dive into challenges. I'm willing to learn the things I don't know and invest in sharing all I know. 


**Most recently**, I've been working as a Technical and UX writer at a software company. My day-to-day functions are being the connection between product managers, developers, marketing specialists, and designers, concerning the content creation + microcopy for software products, and app features. 

In order to keep the whole communication between teams connected and to provide users with full-scale service, I manage to work also with our customer support specialists, providing help center articles and how-tos for end users. Also, keeping a tone of voice and style to the produced content.


Personally, I consider the idea of making a product or service much more accessible and user-friendly via content creation exciting and demanding as well.

**Hopefully**, this cover letter will bring out a bit more about me as a person and a professional :)

Thanks

Zhelyazko Zhelyazkov
