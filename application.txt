###**Technical Writer cover letter**

Hello, 
My name's Zhelyazko,

Long story short, I've been in a writing-for-a-living mode for 10+ years.

** Most recently** , I've been working as a Technical and UX writer at a software company, creating content focused on technical (and sometimes) non-technical audiences.
Furthermore, my position aimed to be a cross-functional collaboration between product managers, customer support specialists, and UI designers, using Jira as an agile project management tool. 
Some of the main day-to-day tasks and content forms:

*technical writing
 * producing elaborate customer-centric technical documentation;
 * creating and editing content in .xml and .strings, while collaborating with developers;
 * product-testing before publishing content;
 * describing work flow of apps and features;
 * help center articles and how-tos;
 * in-app UX content and technical microcopy - keeping the app functions clear and helpful to end-users (tooltips, messages, pop-ups, etc);
 * use cases;
* Content writing
 * content management systems;
 * image editing;
 * onboarding activities;
 * blog content, etc.

*additional activities -  Markdown and Github usage.

** In addition **, Iâ€™ve got hands-on experience in content creation for financial institutions (online trading, blockchain tech, cryptocurrency topics), technical descriptions of healthcare products, social media content, web content, architecture journals, ad scenarios, blog and web content, etc. 
I'm used to working in larger teams, cooperating with just a few professionals, or managing projects independently. I thrive in a technical and creative environment, and like to dive into challenges. I'm willing to learn the things I don't know and invest in sharing all I know.

Hopefully, this cover letter will bring out a bit more about me as a personality and a professional.
