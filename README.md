### Technical and UX writer cover letter


Hello, 

**Long story short**, I've been in a writing mode for 10+ years now.

**Most recently**, I've been working as a Technical and UX writer at a software company, creating content focused on technical and (sometimes) non-technical audiences.

**Furthermore**, my position aimed to be a cross-functional collaboration between product managers, developers, QA, marketing and sales department, customer support specialists, and UI designers, using Jira as an agile project management tool.

**Some of the main day-to-day tasks and content forms**:
- producing elaborate customer-centric technical documentation;
- conducting interviews(communicating) with SMEs to gather and communicate further knowledge for products and services;
- humanising the technical aspects of the software into user-focused copy;
- editing content in .xml and .strings, while collaborating with developers;
- editing and proofreading;
- product-testing before publishing content;
- describing work flow of apps and features;
- help centre articles and how-tos;
- in-app UX content and technical microcopy - keeping the app functions clear and helpful to end-users (tooltips, messages, push notifications, pop-ups, etc);
- use cases;
- content management systems;
- image editing;
- onboarding activities;
- blog technical content, etc.

**In addition**, Iâ€™ve got hands-on experience in content creation for financial institutions (online trading, blockchain tech, cryptocurrency topics), technical descriptions of healthcare products, social media content, web content, architecture journals, ad scenarios, blog and web content, etc.

**I'm used to working in larger teams**, cooperating with just a few professionals, or managing projects independently. I thrive in a technical and creative environment, and like to dive into challenges. I'm willing to learn the things I don't know and invest in sharing all I know.

**Additional interests**

All things content, advertising, Markdown and Github usage; travelling for music, food and landscapes, flashfiction.

**Hopefully**, this cover letter will bring out a bit more about me as a personality and a professional.
